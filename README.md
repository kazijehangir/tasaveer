Media management solution building on top of existing tools like Phockup.


I'm planning to create a GUI tool for managing media (photos and videos). The goal is to make it easier to maintain a canonical local directory-based archive of media, which contains all images from old camera backups, dslr imports, and google photos takeout, while also supporting continous mobile and mirrorless camera uploads and ingestion. Then something like immich can be the viewing layer with support for facial recognition and tagging etc.
I'm planning to leverage existing open source tools like phockup and immich-go as much as possible.
