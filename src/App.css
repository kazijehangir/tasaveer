/* App.css - Cleaned up to avoid conflicts with Tailwind */

  /* No overrides here, rely on index.css and Tailwind */

/* Animations that are not yet in Tailwind config can stay, 
   but ideally should be moved to tailwind.config.js or index.css @layer utilities */

/* Removed all generic element selectors (a, button, input, h1, etc.) 
   to let Tailwind reset and utility classes take precedence. */
